port =>layer 4 transport
TCP Guarantee
UDP not guarantee
BSD style sockets

ipconfig flushes

UNC style path:
Microsoft Windows uses the following types of paths: local file system (LFS), such as C:\File. uniform naming convention (UNC),
such as \\Server\Volume\File or / <internet resource name>[\Directory name] (at least in Windows 7 and later)

session layer
compare file transfer efficiency
ftp port 21, (.31=>.155, use Wireshark sort by Source ), 50, highly efficient but not secure
sftp(secure file transfer protocol) port 22(.157=.>155), 200(50 times 4)
smb:.32=>.155 800, windows style 
daemon (d means server)

netstat -a
shows summary statistics for each protocol, UDP and TCP
UDP: no guarantee delivery, packet can be lost
TCP: 3-way-handshake
1500 byte payload, how big is the packet?

A sliding window protocol:a feature of packet-based data transmission protocols
The term "window" on the transmitter side represents the logical boundary of the total number of packets yet to be acknowledged by the receiver. 

port
surt is a mail server, how about port

telnet surt.csc130.parkland.edu 25
ctrl+c to quit
open another shell and type
netstat -n 192.168.1.13:1043, 1043 is the port
if the port is closed, ask for reset, packet is returned by closed port
SYN
RST
RST
RST

--------0207
connect by the port we specify
telnet olin 22
netstat -n 
(port 22 is secure, if you make mistake, send FIN to end the communication)
port 25 is different, still connected 

telnet surt.csc130.parkland.edu 255 
surt is not listening on port 255
RST: RESET

a virus is a binary
but worm can be a text
don't turn off ping!
closed port return packets

layer 3 Network
Check if in my network, if yes=>ARP
if not=> check the default gateway(the only one machine knows outside)
ping olin(a server on my network)
TTL=64
ping 192.168.1.12(a known windows on my network)
TTL=128
ping 192.168.1.1(a rounter on my network)
TTL=255
ping 10.10.1.1 (first router outside my network)
TTL=254(means one hop way from 255)

change network: from 192.168.1.31 to 10.10.1.31
now ping 192.168.1.12
TTL = 126 (went through 2 routers, so 2 hops taken away)
packets got seen twice, once when it goes in, second time get routed

!!wireshark tutorial!!

tracert 10.10.1.31
TRACEROUTE (TRACERT)
Traceroute (also known as tracert) is a computer network tool used to determine the route taken by packets across an IP network. 
Traceroute is often used for network troubleshooting. 
By showing a list of routers traversed, it allows the user to identify the path taken to reach a particular destination on the network.

Network latency
Network latency is the term used to indicate any kind of delay that happens in data communication over a network. 
Network connections in which small delays occur are called low-latency networks whereas network connections which suffers from long delays are called high-latency networks.


layer 2 Data link
when machine senses the packet:CRC is written at the end(tail) of package identification
Cyclic redundancy check

--------0212

Layer 2 guarantee the integrity of the packet

a packet begins with MAC ends with CRC

DNS VS FQDN
For example, www.indiana.edu is the FQDN on the web for IU. In this case, www is the name of the host in the indiana.edu domain. 
When connecting to a host (using an SSH client, for example), you must specify the FQDN. 
The DNS server then resolves the hostname to its IP address by looking at its DNS table
