netstat -a
shows summary statistics for each protocol, UDP and TCP

A sliding window protocol:a feature of packet-based data transmission protocols
The term "window" on the transmitter side represents the logical boundary of the total number of packets yet to be acknowledged by the receiver.

telnet surt.csc130.parkland.edu 25
ctrl+c to quit
open another shell and type
netstat -n 192.168.1.13:1043, 1043 is the port
if the port is closed, ask for reset, packet is returned by closed port

--------0207

telnet olin 22
netstat -n 
(port 22 is secure, if you make mistake, send FIN to end the communication)
port 25 is different, still connected 

telnet surt.csc130.parkland.edu 255 
surt is not listening on port 255

layer 3 Network
Check if in my network, if yes=>ARP
if not=> check the default gateway(the only one machine knows outside)
ping olin(a server on my network)
TTL=64
ping 192.168.1.12(a known windows on my network)
TTL=128
ping 192.168.1.1(a rounter on my network)
TTL=255
ping 10.10.1.1 (first router outside my network)
TTL=254(means one hop way from 255)

change network: from 192.168.1.31 to 10.10.1.31
now ping 192.168.1.12
TTL = 126 (went through 2 routers, so 2 hops taken away)
packets got seen twice, once when it goes in, second time get routed

tracert 10.10.1.31
TRACEROUTE (TRACERT)
Traceroute (also known as tracert) is a computer network tool used to determine the route taken by packets across an IP network. 
Traceroute is often used for network troubleshooting. 
By showing a list of routers traversed, it allows the user to identify the path taken to reach a particular destination on the network.

Network latency
Network latency is the term used to indicate any kind of delay that happens in data communication over a network. 
Network connections in which small delays occur are called low-latency networks whereas network connections which suffers from long delays are called high-latency networks.

DNS VS FQDN
For example, www.indiana.edu is the FQDN on the web for IU. In this case, www is the name of the host in the indiana.edu domain. 
When connecting to a host (using an SSH client, for example), you must specify the FQDN. 
The DNS server then resolves the hostname to its IP address by looking at its DNS table

authorization is taking place
When you log on to a PC with a user name and password you are authenticating. Authorization is the process of verifying that you have access to something. 
Gaining access to a resource (e.g. directory on a hard disk) because the permissions configured on it allow you access is authorization.
a file is created with a umask 644, rw-r--r--, 6 is 110, 4 is 100

the block(umask) is put on the bridge between inode and the actual data, not on the inode 
you can still see it

on NEWSHARE
even though you can't open other's file, you can delete it
because the directory is world-read, write, execute-able( parrent permission) which controls if you can delete the file inside it
three layers of controls: 1.permission, 2. attributes, 3. ACL
 
neglogon permission: drwxrwxrwt, t: sticky bit, only the file owner can delete it
the permission won't apply to root

need to have a directory to share(even for one file)
authorization is happening along the whole path, but check the parent folder first
create mask 700=>644
depends on which directory you drag files into, it changes the access to the files
front-end to back-end

The difference between AUTH(entication) and Authorization and how a file is stored. - We found that even though all of our files that were in the \\OLIN\NETLOGON share could only be executed by us, ANYONE could delete them. There is a difference in how files are opened, so for instance if a file was opened to execute the local file permission denying anyone else execute access denied that. 
BUT if someone tried to open the file for deletion the permission for the parent directory was checked and since anyone could do anything at that level, the file would be deleted.
To prevent this, we employed the "sticky bit" which can be viewed like this on shaula.csit.parkland.edu 
ls -ld /tmp which will show that the permission on the /tmp directory is:
drwxrwxrwt where the t is the "sticky" bit. This sticky bit allows anyone to execute the directory which means "pass through it" but it forces ownership of a file to delete it. 
The permission to set the sticky bit on a publicly writable directory is:
chmod 1777 dirname 
Also remember this little bit of complication was created by the fact that there is interaction between 2 services, Samba server and the local Linux file services. Gotta watch for that! 
See Also: man chmod and our Linux textbook for a more complete handling of the sticky bit.
